Hello!

This repository is planned for practicing Genetic Algorithms. Maybe it will grow into some Artificial Intelligence project, let's see.

For now, in folder GaloppCpp, you can find an example of an implemented Genetic Algorithm for a game named Galopp.

QtProject is a version with UI. To open the project, you will need Qt IDE (open source package for Application development): https://info.qt.io/download-qt-for-application-development. If for some reason there are problems to build a project, you can find built one in "Application" folder.

ConsoleProject is a version for console. It is advised to use CodeBlocks IDE for this: http://www.codeblocks.org/. Or you can just execute ConsoleProject/bin/Release/GeneticAlgorithmProjectCPP and see how it works.

PokerOpenAI is a new sub-project, where a Texas Holdem player will be implemented. We haven't yet decided what algorithm to apply to make an intelligent Poker Player.

You are welcome to contribute to an existing sub-project, as well as to introduce a new one.
