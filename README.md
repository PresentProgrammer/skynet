Hello!

This repository is planned for practicing Genetic Algorythms. Maybe it will grow into some Artificial Intelligence project, let's see.

For now, in folder GaloppCpp, you can find an example of an implemented Genetic Algorythm for a game named Galopp.

To open the project, you will need Qt IDE (open source package for Application development): https://info.qt.io/download-qt-for-application-development

You are welcome to contribute to an existing sub-project, as well as to introduce a new one.
